### Long Mark

Have you every thought "Dang, those Discord bots are so cool, we wish could make our own?"  Probably not.... But we did! 

Our creation, Long Marc, was developed during CutieHack 2020 and features a few fun commands that we made to help us learn Javascript. We started this morning by watching a freecodecamp turotial on Javascript and look where we are now...

Primarily, we used Discord.JS (as it is a Discord bot) as well as a few other fun APIs and libraries to create several fun and cool things you can do with your friends while stuck at home and vibing on Discord!

Long Mark was developed by four freshman: Nathan Melwani, Anthony Page, Angelika Bermudez, and Jason Guan.

#### Setup/Install
 1. Install the latest version of NPM.
 2. Install the latest version of git.
 3. Unpack and install both of these. 
 4. Restart your computer.
 5. Go to our [Github Repository](https://github.com/NateM135/ZoobBot) and find the Green button that says clone or download. Click it and select Download Zip.
 6. Extract the contents of the zip to a folder of your choosing. You will need to know the path to this file later.
 7. Open the config.json file in a text editor of your choosing, I suggest [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
 8. Place your token in the quotes. Example: "token here"
 9. Save your config.json file and close out of it.
 10. Open up a command prompt with Administrator permissions (In Windows 10, click the Cortana Search bar on the bottom left hand corner and type Command Prompt, right click on it and click Run as Administrator. 
 11. Open the folder that the bot files were unzipped to. Double click the folder name in the upper bar and copy the file path. 
 12. In the Command Prompt type cd and then paste in the file path. Note: You cannot paste a filepath using Control + V, you HAVE TO RIGHT CLICK AND SELECT PASTE.
 13. Type npm init -y
 14. Type npm install discord.js
 15. Type npm install node-fetch
 16: Type node main.js
 14. The bot should now run! Once you see the message "Ready" then the bot is online!
